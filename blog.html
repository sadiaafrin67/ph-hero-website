                    <p class="mb-5 font-medium text-gray-500 ">Var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while let and const are block scoped. Var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope; let variables can be updated but not re-declared; const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared.They are all hoisted to the top of their scope. But while var variables are initialized with undefined, let and const variables are not initialized.
                        While var and let can be declared without being initialized, const must be initialized during declaration.</p>

                    <p class="mb-5 font-medium text-gray-500">Undefined means the variable has been declared, but its value has not been assigned. Null means an empty value or a blank value. The typeof() operator returns undefined for an undefined variable. The typeof() operator returns the type as an object for a variable whose value is assigned as null.</p>

                    <p class="mb-5 font-medium text-gray-500"> An API, or application programming interface, is a set of rules that define how applications or devices can connect to and communicate with each other. A REST API is an API that conforms to the design principles of the REST, or representational state transfer architectural style.</p>
